English Alphabets
Given a square matrix of alphabets which contain English letters in arbitrary manner. While searching a word in it, you can go left to right horizontally, vertically downwards or diagonally towards left (both upwards and downwards).
 
You have to find the number of matches of a given word in the matrix.

For example, In the given square matrix {A#A#K,A#S#K,A#K#K},
                                                            
                                                                                                                                             
The word "ASK"  is matched four times in the input matrix. So the output will be 4.
